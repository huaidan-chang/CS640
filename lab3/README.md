## Discription
Modify virtual router to:  
1. Generate Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) messages when error conditions
occur.  
2. Populate the ARP cache by generating and consuming Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) messages.  
3. Build a routing table using distance vector routing. With these changes, virtual router will no longer depend on a static ARP cache or static route table, and it will be pingable and traceable.
