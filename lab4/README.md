## Discription
Implementation of two control applications for a software defined network (SDN). A layer-3 routing application will install rules in SDN switches to forward traffic to hosts using the shortest, valid path through the network. A distributed load balancer application will redirect new TCP connections to hosts in a round-robin order.
